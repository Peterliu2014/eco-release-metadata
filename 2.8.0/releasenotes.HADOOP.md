* [HADOOP-9477](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-9477) | *Major* | **Add posixGroups support for LDAP groups mapping service**

Add posixGroups support for LDAP groups mapping service. The change in LDAPGroupMapping is compatible with previous scenario. In LDAP, the group mapping between {{posixAccount}} and {{posixGroup}} is different from the general LDAPGroupMapping, one of the differences is the {{"memberUid"}} will be used to mapping {{posixAccount}} and {{posixGroup}}. The feature will handle the mapping in internal when configuration {{hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.search.filter.user}} is set as "posixAccount" and {{hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.search.filter.group}} is "posixGroup".
