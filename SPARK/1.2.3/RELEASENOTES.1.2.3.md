* [SPARK-6753](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-6753) | *Minor* | **Unit test for SPARK-3426 (in ShuffleSuite) doesn't correctly clone the SparkConf**

As a result, that test always uses the default shuffle settings, rather than using the shuffle manager / other settings set by tests that extend ShuffleSuite.

* [SPARK-5969](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-5969) | *Major* | **The pyspark.rdd.sortByKey always fills only two partitions when ascending=False.**

The pyspark.rdd.sortByKey always fills only two partitions when ascending=False -- the first one and the last one.

Simple example sorting numbers 0..999 into 10 partitions in descending order:
{code}
sc.parallelize(range(1000)).keyBy(lambda x:x).sortByKey(ascending=False, numPartitions=10).glom().map(len).collect()
{code}
returns the following partition sizes:
{code}
[469, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 531]
{code}

When ascending=True, all works as expected:
{code}
sc.parallelize(range(1000)).keyBy(lambda x:x).sortByKey(ascending=True, numPartitions=10).glom().map(len).collect()
Out: [116, 96, 100, 87, 132, 101, 101, 95, 87, 85]
{code}

The problem is caused by the following line 565 in rdd.py:
{code}
        samples = sorted(samples, reverse=(not ascending), key=keyfunc)
{code}
That sorts the samples descending if ascending=False. Nevertheless samples should always be in ascending order, because it is (after subsampling to variable bounds) used in a bisect\_left call:
{code}
        def rangePartitioner(k):
            p = bisect.bisect\_left(bounds, keyfunc(k))
            if ascending:
                return p
            else:
                return numPartitions - 1 - p
{code}

As you can see, rangePartitioner already handles the ascending=False by itself, so the fix for the whole problem is really trivial: just change line rdd.py:565 to
{{samples = sorted(samples, -reverse=(not ascending),- key=keyfunc)}}
