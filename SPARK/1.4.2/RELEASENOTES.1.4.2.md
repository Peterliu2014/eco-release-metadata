* [SPARK-10960](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10960) | *Major* | **SQL with windowing function cannot reference column in inner select block**

There seems to be a bug in the Spark SQL parser when I use windowing functions. Specifically, when the SELECT refers to a column from an inner select block, the parser throws an error.

Here is an example:
--------------------------
When I use a windowing function and add a '1' constant to the result, 
{code}
   select Rank() OVER ( ORDER BY D1.c3 ) + 1 as c1
{code}

The Spark SQL parser works. The whole SQL is:
{code}
select Rank() OVER ( ORDER BY D1.c3 ) + 1 as c1,
                         D1.c3 as c3,
                         D1.c4 as c4,
                         D1.c5 as c5
                    from 
                         (select T3671.ROW\_WID as c3,
                                   T3671.CAL\_MONTH as c4,
                                   T3671.CAL\_YEAR as c5,
                                   1 as c6
                              from 
                                   W\_DAY\_D T3671
                         ) D1
{code}

However, if I change the projection so that it refers to a column in an inner select block, D1.C6, whose value is itself a '1' literal, so it is functionally equivalent to the SQL above, Spark SQL will throw an error:
{code}
select Rank() OVER ( ORDER BY D1.c3 ) + D1.C6 as c1,
                         D1.c3 as c3,
                         D1.c4 as c4,
                         D1.c5 as c5
                    from 
                         (select T3671.ROW\_WID as c3,
                                   T3671.CAL\_MONTH as c4,
                                   T3671.CAL\_YEAR as c5,
                                   1 as c6
                              from 
                                   W\_DAY\_D T3671
                         ) D1
{code}

The error message is:
{code}
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\> java.lang.NullPointerException
Error: org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: resolved attribute(s) c6#3386 missing from c5#3390
,c3#3383,c4#3389,\_we0#3461,c3#3388 in operator !Project [c3#3388,c4#3389,c5#3390,c3#3383,\_we0#346
1,(\_we0#3461 + c6#3386) AS c1#3387]; (state=,code=0)
{code}

The above example is a simplified version of the SQL I was testing. The full SQL I was using, which fails with a similar error, is as follows:

{code}
select Case when case D1.c6 when 1 then D1.c3 else NULL end  is not null then Rank() OVER ( ORDER BY case when ( case D1.c6 when 1 then D1.c3 else NULL end  ) is null then 1 else 0 end, case D1.c6 when 1 then D1.c3 else NULL end ) end as c1,
                         Case when case D1.c7 when 1 then D1.c3 else NULL end  is not null then Rank() OVER ( PARTITION BY D1.c4, D1.c5 ORDER BY case when ( case D1.c7 when 1 then D1.c3 else NULL end  ) is null then 1 else 0 end, case D1.c7 when 1 then D1.c3 else NULL end ) end as c2,
                         D1.c3 as c3,
                         D1.c4 as c4,
                         D1.c5 as c5
                    from 
                         (select T3671.ROW\_WID as c3,
                                   T3671.CAL\_MONTH as c4,
                                   T3671.CAL\_YEAR as c5,
                                   ROW\_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY T3671.CAL\_MONTH, T3671.CAL\_YEAR ORDER BY T3671.CAL\_MONTH DESC, T3671.CAL\_YEAR DESC) as c6,
                                   ROW\_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY T3671.CAL\_MONTH, T3671.CAL\_YEAR, T3671.ROW\_WID ORDER BY T3671.CAL\_MONTH DESC, T3671.CAL\_YEAR DESC, T3671.ROW\_WID DESC) as c7
                              from 
                                   W\_DAY\_D T3671
                         ) D1
{code}

Hopefully when fixed, both these sample SQLs should work!

As of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-7561, we no longer need to use our custom SCP-based mechanism for archiving Jenkins logs on the master machine; this has been superseded by the use of a Jenkins plugin which archives the logs and provides public viewing of them.

We should remove the legacy log syncing code, since this is a blocker to disabling Worker -\> Master SSH on Jenkins.

* [SPARK-10556](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10556) | *Minor* | **SBT build explicitly sets Scala version, which can conflict with SBT's own scala version**

project/plugins.sbt explicitly sets scalaVersion to 2.10.4. This can cause issues when using a version of sbt that is compiled against a different version of Scala (for example sbt 0.13.9 uses 2.10.5). Removing this explicit setting will cause build files to be compiled and run against the same version of Scala that sbt is compiled against.

Note that this only applies to the project build files (items in project/), it is distinct from the version of Scala we target for the actual spark compilation.

* [SPARK-10381](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10381) | *Critical* | **Infinite loop when OutputCommitCoordination is enabled and OutputCommitter.commitTask throws exception**

When speculative execution is enabled, consider a scenario where the authorized committer of a particular output partition fails during the OutputCommitter.commitTask() call. In this case, the OutputCommitCoordinator is supposed to release that committer's exclusive lock on committing once that task fails. However, due to a unit mismatch the lock will not be released, causing Spark to go into an infinite retry loop.

This bug was masked by the fact that the OutputCommitCoordinator does not have enough end-to-end tests (the current tests use many mocks). Other factors contributing to this bug are the fact that we have many similarly-named identifiers that have different semantics but the same data types (e.g. attemptNumber and taskAttemptId, with inconsistent variable naming which makes them difficult to distinguish).

* [SPARK-10377](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10377) | *Major* | **Cassandra connector affected by backport change**

The backport in SPARK-7289 and SPARK-9949 includes the refactor of TakeOrdered to TakeOrderedAndProject, which breaks code that refers to TakeOrdered. In a minor version update that is perhaps not expected - specifically, the Cassandra connector refers to this by name and no longer works.

Example use case it to use the Cassandra connector in Scala and creating a CassandraSQLContext:
import com.datastax.spark.connector.\_
import sqlContext.implicits.\_
import org.apache.spark.sql.cassandra.CassandraSQLContext

val cassandraSQLContext = new CassandraSQLContext(sc);

java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.spark.sql.cassandra.CassandraSQLContext$$anon$1.TakeOrdered()Lorg/apache/spark/sql/execution/SparkStrategies$TakeOrdered$;

	at org.apache.spark.sql.cassandra.CassandraSQLContext.\<init\>(CassandraSQLContext.scala:85)

(Source code link: https://github.com/datastax/spark-cassandra-connector/blob/v1.4.0-M3/spark-cassandra-connector/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/cassandra/CassandraSQLContext.scala) 
This is with version 1.4.0M3 of the Datastax Cassandra connector, but affects other 1.4 versions as well.

Issue has also been reported to Datastax, here:

* [SPARK-10169](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10169) | *Critical* | **Evaluating AggregateFunction1 (old code path) may return wrong answers when grouping expressions are used as arguments of aggregate functions**

Before Spark 1.5, if an aggregate function use an grouping expression as input argument, the result of the query can be wrong. The reason is we are using transformUp when we do aggregate results rewriting (see https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-1.4/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/planning/patterns.scala#L154). 

To reproduce the problem, you can use
{code}
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions.\_
sc.parallelize((1 to 1000), 50).map(i =\> Tuple1(i)).toDF("i").registerTempTable("t")
sqlContext.sql(""" 
select i % 10, sum(if(i % 10 = 5, 1, 0)), count(i)
from t
where i % 10 = 5
group by i % 10""").explain()

In Spark 1.5, new aggregation code path does not have the problem. The old code path is fixed by https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/dd9ae7945ab65d353ed2b113e0c1a00a0533ffd6.

* [SPARK-10071](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10071) | *Major* | **QueueInputDStream Should Allow Checkpointing**

I would like for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-8630 to be reverted and that issue resolved as wonâ€™t fix, and for QueueInputDStream to revert to its old behavior of not throwing an exception if checkpointing is
enabled.

Why? The reason is that this fix which throws an exception if the DStream is being checkpointed breaks the primary use case for QueueInputDStream, which is testing. For example, the Spark Streaming documentation recommends using QueueInputDStream for testing.

Why does throwing an exception if checkpointing is used break this class? The reason is that if I use windowing operations or updateStateByKey then the StreamingContext requires that I enable checkpointing. It throws an exception if I donâ€™t enable checkpointing. But then if I enable checkpointing this class throws an exception saying that I cannot use checkpointing with the queue stream. The end result of this is that I cannot use QueueInputDStream to test windowing operations and updateStateByKey. It can only be used for trivial stateless DStreams.

But would removing the exception-throwing logic make this code fragile? It should not. In the testing scenario the RDD that is passed into the QueueInputDStream is created through parallelize and it is checkpointable.

But what about people who are using QueueInputDStream in non-testing scenarios with non-recoverable RDDs? Perhaps a warning suffices here that checkpointing will not be able to recover state if their RDDs are non-recoverable. Then it is up to them how they resolve this situation.

Since right now we have no good way of determining if a QueueInputDStream contains RDDs that are recoverable or not, why not err on the side of leaving it to the user of the class to not expect recoverability, rather than forcing checkpointing.

In conclusion: my recommendation would be to revert to the old behavior and to resolve this bug as wonâ€™t fix.

* [SPARK-9978](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-9978) | *Major* | **Window functions require partitionBy to work as expected**

I am trying to reproduce following SQL query:

{code}
df.registerTempTable("df")
sqlContext.sql("SELECT x, row\_number() OVER (ORDER BY x) as rn FROM df").show()

+----+--+
\|   x\|rn\|
+----+--+
\|0.25\| 1\|
\| 0.5\| 2\|
\|0.75\| 3\|
+----+--+
{code}

using PySpark API. Unfortunately it doesn't work as expected:

{code}
from pyspark.sql.window import Window
from pyspark.sql.functions import rowNumber

df = sqlContext.createDataFrame([{"x": 0.25}, {"x": 0.5}, {"x": 0.75}])
df.select(df["x"], rowNumber().over(Window.orderBy("x")).alias("rn")).show()

+----+--+
\|   x\|rn\|
+----+--+
\| 0.5\| 1\|
\|0.25\| 1\|
\|0.75\| 1\|
+----+--+
{code}

As a workaround It is possible to call partitionBy without additional arguments:

{code}
df.select(
    df["x"],
    rowNumber().over(Window.partitionBy().orderBy("x")).alias("rn")
).show()

+----+--+
\|   x\|rn\|
+----+--+
\|0.25\| 1\|
\| 0.5\| 2\|
\|0.75\| 3\|
+----+--+
{code}

but as far as I can tell it is not documented and is rather counterintuitive considering SQL syntax. Moreover this problem doesn't affect Scala API:

{code}
import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.Window
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions.rowNumber

case class Record(x: Double)
val df = sqlContext.createDataFrame(Record(0.25) :: Record(0.5) :: Record(0.75))
df.select($"x", rowNumber().over(Window.orderBy($"x")).alias("rn")).show

+----+--+
\|   x\|rn\|
+----+--+
\|0.25\| 1\|
\| 0.5\| 2\|
\|0.75\| 3\|
+----+--+

* [SPARK-9826](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-9826) | *Minor* | **Cannot use custom classes in log4j.properties**

log4j is initialized before spark class loader is set on the thread context.
Therefore it cannot use classes embedded in fat-jars submitted to spark.

While parsing arguments, spark calls methods on Utils class and triggers ShutdownHookManager static initialization.  This then leads to log4j being initialized before spark gets the chance to specify custom class MutableURLClassLoader on the thread context.

From the source code : 
https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/streaming/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/streaming/Checkpoint.scala

When Spark tries to delete the 2 files, it did not check if the 2 files exist or not. 
fs.delete(tempFile, true) // just in case it exists 
fs.delete(backupFile, true) // just in case it exists

We should add the logic to check if the files exist or not before deleting.

* [SPARK-9353](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-9353) | *Major* | **Standalone scheduling memory requirement incorrect if cores per executor is not set**

I tried to come up with a more succinct title.

The issue only happens if `spark.executor.cores` is not set. Right now if we have a worker with 8G, and we set `spark.executor.memory` to 1G, then the executor launched on the worker can have at most 8 cores, even if the worker has more cores available.

This is caused by the fix in SPARK-8881.

* [SPARK-9326](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-9326) | *Minor* | **Spark never closes the lock file used to prevent concurrent downloads**

A lock file is used to ensure multiple executors running on the same machine don't download the same file concurrently. Spark never closes these lock files (we release the lock, but releasing the lock does not close the  underlying file). In theory, if an executor fetched a large number of files, this could eventually lead to an issue with too many open files.

* [SPARK-9193](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-9193) | *Major* | **Avoid assigning tasks to executors under killing**

Now, when some executors are killed by dynamic-allocation, it leads to some mis-assignment onto lost executors sometimes. Such kind of mis-assignment causes task failure(s) or even job failure if it repeats that errors for 4 times.

The root cause is that killExecutors doesn't remove those executors under killing ASAP. It depends on the OnDisassociated event to refresh the active working list later. The delay time really depends on your cluster status (from several milliseconds to sub-minute). When new tasks to be scheduled during that period of time, it will be assigned to those "active" but "under killing" executors. Then the tasks will be failed due to "executor lost". The better way is to exclude those executors under killing in the makeOffers(). Then all those tasks won't be allocated onto those executors "to be lost" any more.

* [SPARK-9175](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-9175) | *Critical* | **BLAS.gemm fails to update matrix C when alpha==0 and beta!=1**

In the BLAS wrapper, gemm is supposed to update matrix C to be alpha \* A \* B + beta \* C. However, the current implementation will not update C as long as alpha == 0. This is incorrect when beta is not equal to 1. 

Example:
val p = 3 
val a = DenseMatrix.zeros(p,p)
val b = DenseMatrix.zeros(p,p)
var c = DenseMatrix.eye(p)
BLAS.gemm(0, a, b, 5, c)

c is unchanged in the Spark 1.4 even though it should be multiplied by 5 element-wise.

The bug is caused by the following in BLAS.gemm:
if (alpha == 0.0) {
  logDebug("gemm: alpha is equal to 0. Returning C.")
}

Will submit PR to fix this.

Please see pull request for more information.

Currently, PySpark will run an unnecessary comboOp on each partition, combining zeroValue and the results of mapPartitions. Since the zeroValue used in this comboOp is the same reference as the zeroValue used for mapPartitions in each partition, unexpected behavior can happen if zeroValue is a mutable object.

Instead, RDD.aggregate() should do a reduction on the results of each mapPartitions task. This way, we remove the unnecessary initial comboOp on each partition and also correct the unexpected behavior for mutable zeroValues.

* [SPARK-8881](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-8881) | *Critical* | **Standalone mode scheduling fails because cores assignment is not atomic**

Current scheduling algorithm (in Master.scala) has two issues:

1. cores are allocated one at a time instead of spark.executor.cores at a time
2. when spark.cores.max/spark.executor.cores \< num\_workers, executors are not launched and the app hangs (due to 1)

=== Edit by Andrew ===

Here's an example from the PR. Let's say we have 4 workers with 16 cores each. We set `spark.cores.max` to 48 and `spark.executor.cores` to 16. Because in spread out mode, the existing code allocates 1 core at a time, we end up allocating 12 cores on each worker, and no executors can be launched because each one wants at least 16 cores. Instead, we should allocate 16 cores at a time.

* [SPARK-8865](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-8865) | *Minor* | **Fix bug:  init SimpleConsumerConfig with kafka params**

"zookeeper.connect" and "group.id" aren't necessary for anything in the kafka direct stream.

But they're expected to be present in a kafka consumer config, and overriding that behavior wasn't possible. So as a workaround, we set them to a blank string. That way users don't have to define unnecessary settings in the kafka param map passed to the KafkaUtils constructor. We talked through that during the original development of the direct stream.

The code as it is released today is almost always going to set a blank string, regardless of what users pass in, because contains on a java property object is not the equivalent of containsKey, it is containsValue. The intention was that if the user sets those properties (whatever personal reasons they have), the values should not get overwritten with a blank string.

* [SPARK-8593](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-8593) | *Major* | **History Server doesn't show complete application when one attempt inprogress**

The Spark history server doesn't show an application if the first attempt of the application is still inprogress.  

Here are the files in hdfs:
-rwxrwx---   3 tgraves hdfs        234 2015-06-24 15:49 sparkhistory/application\_1433751980223\_18926\_1.inprogress

The UI shows them if I set the showIncomplete=true.

Removing the inprogress file allows it to show up when showIncomplete is false.

It should be smart enough to atleast show the second successful attempt.

* [SPARK-8405](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-8405) | *Major* | **Show executor logs on Web UI when Yarn log aggregation is enabled**

When running Spark application in Yarn mode and Yarn log aggregation is enabled, customer is not able to view executor logs on the history server Web UI. The only way for customer to view the logs is through the Yarn command "yarn logs -applicationId \<appId\>".

An screenshot of the error is attached. When you click an executorâ€™s log link on the Spark history server, youâ€™ll see the error if Yarn log aggregation is enabled. The log URL redirects user to the node managerâ€™s UI. This works if the logs are located on that node. But since log aggregation is enabled, the local logs are deleted once log aggregation is completed. 

The logs should be available through the web UIs just like other Hadoop components like MapReduce. For security reasons, end users may not be able to log into the nodes and run the yarn logs -applicationId command. The web UIs can be viewable and exposed through the firewall if necessary.

testResultsDF.insertIntoJDBC(CONNECTION\_URL, TABLE\_NAME, false);

When I do this now in 1.4 it complains that the "object" 'TABLE\_NAME' already exists. I get this even if I switch the overwrite to true.  I also tried this now:

testResultsDF.write().mode(SaveMode.Append).jdbc(CONNECTION\_URL, TABLE\_NAME, connectionProperties);

getting the same error. It works running the first time creating the new table and adding data successfully. But, running it a second time it (the jdbc driver) will tell me that the table already exists. Even SaveMode.Overwrite will give me the same error.

\* The spark.ml user guide can provide: (a) code examples and (b) info on algorithms which do not exist in spark.mllib.
\* We should not duplicate info in the spark.ml guides. Since spark.mllib is still the primary API, we should provide links to the corresponding algorithms in the spark.mllib user guide for more info.

If the caller invokes

* [SPARK-3190](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-3190) | *Critical* | **Creation of large graph(\> 2.15 B nodes) seems to be broken:possible overflow somewhere**

While creating a graph with 6B nodes and 12B edges, I noticed that 'numVertices' api returns incorrect result; 'numEdges' reports correct number. For few times(with different dataset \> 2.5B nodes) I have also notices that numVertices is returned as -ive number; so I suspect that there is some overflow (may be we are using Int for some field?).

Here is some details of experiments  I have done so far: 
1. Input: numNodes=6101995593 ; noEdges=12163784626
   Graph returns: numVertices=1807028297 ;  numEdges=12163784626

2. Input : numNodes=2157586441 ; noEdges=2747322705
   Graph Returns: numVertices=-2137380855 ;  numEdges=2747322705

3. Input: numNodes=1725060105 ; noEdges=204176821
   Graph: numVertices=1725060105 ;  numEdges=2041768213

The above code creates one million tasks to be executed. The stage detail web ui page takes forever to load (if it ever completes).

There are again a few different alternatives:

0. Limit the number of tasks we show.
1. Pagination
2. By default only show the aggregate metrics and failed tasks, and hide the successful ones.
