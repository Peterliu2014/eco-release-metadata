* [SPARK-7635](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-7635) | *Minor* | **SparkContextSchedulerCreationSuite tests may fail due to unrecognized UnsatisfiedLinkError message.**

When mesos is not available, these tests fail due to the difference in the UnsatisfiedLinkError message with IBM Java vs OpenJDK:

- mesos fine-grained *** FAILED ***
  "mesos (Not found in java.library.path)" did not contain "no mesos in" (SparkContextSchedulerCreationSuite.scala:162)
- mesos coarse-grained *** FAILED ***
  "mesos (Not found in java.library.path)" did not contain "no mesos in" (SparkContextSchedulerCreationSuite.scala:162)
- mesos with zookeeper *** FAILED ***
  "mesos (Not found in java.library.path)" did not contain "no mesos in" (SparkContextSchedulerCreationSuite.scala:162)

PR to be submitted shortly.

* [SPARK-7515](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-7515) | *Minor* | **Update documentation for PySpark on YARN with cluster mode**

Now PySpark on YARN with cluster mode is supported so let's update doc.

* [SPARK-7357](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-7357) | *Minor* | **Improving HBaseTest example**

Minor improvement to HBaseTest example, when Hbase related configurations e.g: zookeeper quorum, zookeeper client port or zookeeper.znode.parent are not set to default (localhost:2181), connection to zookeeper might hang as shown in following stack

15/03/26 18:31:20 INFO zookeeper.ZooKeeper: Initiating client connection, connectString=xxx.xxx.xxx:2181 sessionTimeout=90000 watcher=hconnection-0x322a4437, quorum=xxx.xxx.xxx:2181, baseZNode=/hbase
15/03/26 18:31:21 INFO zookeeper.ClientCnxn: Opening socket connection to server 9.30.94.121:2181. Will not attempt to authenticate using SASL (unknown error)
15/03/26 18:31:21 INFO zookeeper.ClientCnxn: Socket connection established to xxx.xxx.xxx/9.30.94.121:2181, initiating session
15/03/26 18:31:21 INFO zookeeper.ClientCnxn: Session establishment complete on server xxx.xxx.xxx/9.30.94.121:2181, sessionid = 0x14c53cd311e004b, negotiated timeout = 40000
15/03/26 18:31:21 INFO client.ZooKeeperRegistry: ClusterId read in ZooKeeper is null

this is due to hbase-site.xml is not placed on spark class path.
