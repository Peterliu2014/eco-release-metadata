# Apache HBase  1.3.0 Release Notes

These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, features, and major improvements.


---

* [HBASE-14045](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14045) | *Major* | **Bumping thrift version to 0.9.2.**

This changes upgrades thrift dependency of HBase to 0.9.2. Though this doesn't break any HBase compatibility promises, it might impact any downstream projects that share thrift dependency with HBase.


---

* [HBASE-13963](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13963) | *Critical* | **avoid leaking jdk.tools**

HBase now ensures that the JDK tools jar used during the build process is not exposed to downstream clients as a transitive dependency of hbase-annotations.

If you need to have the JDK tools jar in your classpath, you should add a system dependency on it. See the hbase-annotations pom for an example of the necessary pom additions.

* [HBASE-13906](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13906) | *Major* | **Improve handling of NeedUnmanagedConnectionException**

With this patch NeedUnmanagedConnectionException is effectively treated as non-retryable exception, but for backwards compatibility purposes we don't throw it directly, but instead wrap into DoNotRetryIOException when we return error to the caller.


---

* [HBASE-13881](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13881) | *Major* | **Bug in HTable#incrementColumnValue implementation**

HBASE-13881 Correct HTable incrementColumnValue implementation


---

* [HBASE-13666](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13666) | *Major* | **book.pdf is not renamed during site build**

Correct PDF renaming and bump version of maven-antrun-plugin


---

* [HBASE-13103](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13103) | *Major* | **[ergonomics] add region size balancing as a feature of master**

This patch adds optional ability for HMaster to normalize regions in size (disabled by default, change hbase.normalizer.enabled property to true to turn it on). If enabled, HMaster periodically (every 30 minutes by default) monitors tables for which normalization is enabled in table configuration and performs splits/merges as seems appropriate. Users may implement their own normalization strategies by implementing RegionNormalizer interface and configuring it in hbase-site.xml.
