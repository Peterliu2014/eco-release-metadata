* [HBASE-15218](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15218) | *Blocker* | **On RS crash and replay of WAL, loosing all Tags in Cells**

This issue fixes 
- In case of normal WAL (Not encrypted) we were loosing all cell tags on WAL replay after an RS crash
- In case of encrypted WAL we were not even persisting Cell tags in WAL.  Tags from all unflushed (to HFile) Cells will get lost even after WAL replay recovery is done.
