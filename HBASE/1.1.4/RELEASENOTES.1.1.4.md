* [HBASE-15218](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15218) | *Blocker* | **On RS crash and replay of WAL, loosing all Tags in Cells**

This issue fixes 
- In case of normal WAL (Not encrypted) we were loosing all cell tags on WAL replay after an RS crash
- In case of encrypted WAL we were not even persisting Cell tags in WAL.  Tags from all unflushed (to HFile) Cells will get lost even after WAL replay recovery is done.

* [HBASE-15145](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15145) | *Major* | **HBCK and Replication should authenticate to zookepeer using server principal**

Added a new command line argument: --auth-as-server to enable authenticating to ZooKeeper as the HBase Server principal. This is required for secure clusters for doing replication operations like add\_peer, list\_peers, etc until HBASE-11392 is fixed. This advanced option can also be used for manually fixing secure znodes. 

Commands can now be invoked like: 
hbase --auth-as-server shell 
hbase --auth-as-server zkcli 

HBCK in secure setup also needs to authenticate to ZK using servers principals.This is turned on by default (no need to pass additional argument). 

When authenticating as server, HBASE\_SERVER\_JAAS\_OPTS is concatenated to HBASE\_OPTS if defined in hbase-env.sh. Otherwise, HBASE\_REGIONSERVER\_OPTS is concatenated.
