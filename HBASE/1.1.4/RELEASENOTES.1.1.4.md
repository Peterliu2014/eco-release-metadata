* [HBASE-15218](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15218) | *Blocker* | **On RS crash and replay of WAL, loosing all Tags in Cells**

This issue fixes 
- In case of normal WAL (Not encrypted) we were loosing all cell tags on WAL replay after an RS crash
- In case of encrypted WAL we were not even persisting Cell tags in WAL.  Tags from all unflushed (to HFile) Cells will get lost even after WAL replay recovery is done.

As we use tags for Cell level security, this fixes 2 security issues
 - Cell level visibility labels security breach . Making a visibility restricted cell global readable
 - Cell level ACL availability issue.  A user who is cell level authorized to read this cell can not read it. It is a data loss for him.

* [HBASE-15213](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15213) | *Major* | **Fix increment performance regression caused by HBASE-8763 on branch-1.0**

Fixes performance regression in increment/append and checkAnd\* operations in hbase-1.0.x and hbase-1.1.x. This fix is not needed in hbase-1.2 and on up. They have HBASE-12751 which does effectively the same thing.

* [HBASE-15157](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15157) | *Major* | **Add \*PerformanceTest for Append, CheckAnd\***

Add append, increment, checkAndMutate, checkAndPut, and checkAndDelete tests to PerformanceEvaluation tool. Below are excerpts from new usage from PE:

....
Command:
 append          Append on each row; clients overlap on keyspace so some concurrent operations
 checkAndDelete  CheckAndDelete on each row; clients overlap on keyspace so some concurrent operations
 checkAndMutate  CheckAndMutate on each row; clients overlap on keyspace so some concurrent operations
 checkAndPut     CheckAndPut on each row; clients overlap on keyspace so some concurrent operations
 filterScan      Run scan test using a filter to find a specific row based on it's value (make sure to use --rows=20)
 increment       Increment on each row; clients overlap on keyspace so some concurrent operations
 randomRead      Run random read test
....
Examples:
...
 To run 10 clients doing increments over ten rows:
 $ bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.PerformanceEvaluation --rows=10 --nomapred increment 10

Removed IncrementPerformanceTest. It is not as configurable as the additions made here.

* [HBASE-15145](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15145) | *Major* | **HBCK and Replication should authenticate to zookepeer using server principal**

Added a new command line argument: --auth-as-server to enable authenticating to ZooKeeper as the HBase Server principal. This is required for secure clusters for doing replication operations like add\_peer, list\_peers, etc until HBASE-11392 is fixed. This advanced option can also be used for manually fixing secure znodes. 

Commands can now be invoked like: 
hbase --auth-as-server shell 
hbase --auth-as-server zkcli 

HBCK in secure setup also needs to authenticate to ZK using servers principals.This is turned on by default (no need to pass additional argument). 

When authenticating as server, HBASE\_SERVER\_JAAS\_OPTS is concatenated to HBASE\_OPTS if defined in hbase-env.sh. Otherwise, HBASE\_REGIONSERVER\_OPTS is concatenated.

* [HBASE-14460](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14460) | *Critical* | **[Perf Regression] Merge of MVCC and SequenceId (HBASE-8763) slowed Increments, CheckAndPuts, batch operations**

This release note tries to tell the general story. Dive into sub-tasks for more specific release noting.

Increments, appends, checkAnd\* have been slow since hbase-.1.0.0. The unification of mvcc and sequence id done by HBASE-8763 was responsible.

A ‘fast-path’ workaround was added by HBASE-15031 “Fix merge of MVCC and SequenceID performance regression in branch-1.0 for Increments”. It became available in 1.0.3 and 1.1.3. To enable the fast path, set "hbase.increment.fast.but.narrow.consistency" and then rolling restart. The workaround was for increments only (appends, checkAndPut, etc., were not addressed. See HBASE-15031 release note for more detail).

Subsequently, the regression was properly identified and fixed in HBASE-15213 and the fix applied to branch-1.0 and branch-1.1. As it happens, hbase-1.2.0 does not suffer from the performance regression (though the thought was that it did -- and so it got the fast-path patch too via HBASE-15092) nor does the master branch. HBASE-15213 identified that HBASE-12751 (as a side effect) had cured the regression.

hbase-1.0.4 (if it is ever released -- 1.0 has been end-of-lifed) and hbase-1.1.4 will have the HBASE-15213 fix.  If you are suffering from the increment regression and you are on 1.0.3 or 1.1.3, you can enable the work around to get back your increment performance but you should upgrade.
