# Apache HBase  0.98.14 Release Notes

These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, features, and major improvements.

* [HBASE-13963](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13963) | *Critical* | **avoid leaking jdk.tools**

HBase now ensures that the JDK tools jar used during the build process is not exposed to downstream clients as a transitive dependency of hbase-annotations.

If you need to have the JDK tools jar in your classpath, you should add a system dependency on it. See the hbase-annotations pom for an example of the necessary pom additions.


---

* [HBASE-13849](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13849) | *Major* | **Remove restore and clone snapshot from the WebUI**

The HBase master status web page no longer allows operators to clone snapshots nor restore snapshots.


---

* [HBASE-13666](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13666) | *Major* | **book.pdf is not renamed during site build**

Correct PDF renaming and bump version of maven-antrun-plugin


---

* [HBASE-13646](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13646) | *Major* | **HRegion#execService should not try to build incomplete messages**

When RegionServerCoprocessors throw an exception we will no longer attempt to build an incomplete RPC response message. Instead, the response message will be null.
