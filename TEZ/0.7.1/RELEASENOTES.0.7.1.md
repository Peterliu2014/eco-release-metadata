* [TEZ-2453](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TEZ-2453) | *Major* | **Tez UI: show the dagInfo is the application has set the same.**

hive/pig etc can set additional info on the dag using 

{code}
/**
   * Set description info for this DAG that can be used for visualization purposes.
   * @param dagInfo JSON blob as a serialized string.
   *                Recognized keys by the UI are:
   *                    "context" - The application context in which this DAG is being used.
   *                                For example, this could be set to "Hive" or "Pig" if
   *                                this is being run as part of a Hive or Pig script.
   *                    "description" - General description on what this DAG is going to do.
   *                                In the case of Hive, this could be the SQL query text.
   * @return {@link DAG}
   */
{code}
It would be useful to show this information.
