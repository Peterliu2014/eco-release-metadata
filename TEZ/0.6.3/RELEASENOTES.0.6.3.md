* [TEZ-2630](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TEZ-2630) | *Critical* | **TezChild receives IP address instead of FQDN**

I am running a yarn cluster on AWS. The slave nodes (NMs) are all configured to listen on private DNS. For example, a sample node manager listens on ip-10-16-141-168.ec2.internal:8042.

When I'm trying to run a Tez job (even simple ones like select count(*) from nation) - they fail because child tasks are unable to connect to the AM. The issue is they are trying to connect to the IP instead of the private DNS. Here's a sample log line (couple of them added by me for debugging):

{code}

{code}

AM is listening at the right address. But TezChild is receiving the IP address instead of the private DNS. 

AM logs:
