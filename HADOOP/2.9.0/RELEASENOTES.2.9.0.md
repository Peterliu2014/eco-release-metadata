* [MAPREDUCE-6622](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-6622) | *Critical* | **Add capability to set JHS job cache to a task-based limit**

Two recommendations for the mapreduce.jobhistory.loadedtasks.cache.size property:
1) For every 100k of cache size, set the heap size of the Job History Server to 1.2GB.  For example, mapreduce.jobhistory.loadedtasks.cache.size=500000, heap size=6GB.
2) Make sure that the cache size is larger than the number of tasks required for the largest job run on the cluster.  It might be a good idea to set the value slightly higher (say, 20%) in order to allow for job size growth.
